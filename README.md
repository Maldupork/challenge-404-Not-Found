## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/WardDispenser/challenge-404-Not-Found/blob/main/img/page.png)

I made this and learned a lot from it. I already knew CSS and HTML, made a lot of pages but never by myself or alone, so now I know some of my knowledges were not quite right.

- Where can I see your demo?
You can visit it in https://voluble-dolphin-901923.netlify.app
- What was your experience?
I was learning PHP and forgot a lot of basic things about CSS
- What have you learned/improved?
A lot, as I said, nice to remember and reinforce old knowledge.
